 [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mThis species of ant is native to Argentina and Brazil and was probably introduced to the United States in freight ships around the 1890â€™s. These ants can be found in southern states and in California, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, Oregon and Washington.Argentine ants prefer sweet substances but will eat almost anything including meats, eggs, oils and fats. Also, when foraging for food, Argentine ants leave pheromone trails everywhere they go, instead of just from nest to food source. This habit ensures they do not waste time visiting the same area twice. While in other ant species worker ants are primarily responsible for gather food, Argentine queens also assist with foraging for food.Argentine ant colonies are located in wet environments near a food source. These colonies can grow to monumental size, sometimes covering entire habitats, such as an entire garden or your whole back yard.Argentine ants do not pose a health threat, but they can contaminate food by leaving their bodily waste behind.Â Teachers, are you looking for more instructive materials to share with your students?
